abstract = {Abstract We consider a tree that grows randomly in time. Each time a new vertex appears, it chooses exactly one of the existing vertices and attaches to it. The probability that the new vertex chooses vertex x is proportional to w(deg(x)), a weight function of the actual degree of x. The weight function w : ℕ → ℝ+ is the parameter of the model. In 4 and 11 the authors derive the asymptotic degree distribution for a model that is equivalent to the special case, when the weight function is linear. The proof therein strongly relies on the linear choice of w. Using well-established results from the theory of general branching processes we give the asymptotical degree distribution for a wide range of weight functions. Moreover, we provide the asymptotic distribution of the tree itself as seen from a randomly selected vertex. The latter approach gives greater insight to the limiting structure of the tree. Our proof is robust and we believe that the method may be used to answer several other questions related to the model. It relies on the fact that considering the evolution of the random tree in continuous time, the process may be viewed as a general branching process, this way classical results can be applied. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.}}

 abstract = {A dynamic model for a random network evolving in continuous time is defined, where new vertices are born and existing vertices may die. The fitness of a vertex is defined as the accumulated in-degree of the vertex and a new vertex is connected to an existing vertex with probability proportional to a function b of the fitness of the existing vertex. Furthermore, a vertex dies at a rate given by a function d of its fitness. Using results from the theory of general branching processes, an expression for the asymptotic empirical fitness distribution {p k } is derived and analyzed for a number of specific choices of b and d. When b(i) = i + α and d(i) = β, that is, linear preferential attachment for the newborn and random deaths, then p k ~ k −(2+α) . When b(i) = i + 1 and d(i) = β(i + 1), with β < 1, then p k ~ (1 + β) −k , that is, if the death rate is also proportional to the fitness, then the power-law distribution is lost. Furthermore, when b(i) = i + 1 and d(i) = β(i + 1) γ , with β, γ < 1, then log p k ~ −k γ , a stretched exponential distribution. The momentaneous in-degrees are also studied and simulations suggest that their behaviour is qualitatively similar to that of the fitnesses.},
