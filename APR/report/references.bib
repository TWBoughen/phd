abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.}}

abstract = {An efficient, generic and simple to use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for partially observed temporal epidemic models is introduced. The algorithm is designed to be adaptive so that it can easily be used by non-experts. There are two key features incorporated in the algorithm to develop an efficient algorithm, parameter reduction and efficient, multiple updates of the augmented infection times. The algorithm is successfully applied to two real life epidemic data sets, the Abakaliki smallpox data and the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth epidemic in Cumbria.}

abstract = {Random networks with complex topology are common in Nature, describing systems as diverse as the world wide web or social and business networks. Recently, it has been demonstrated that most large networks for which topological information is available display scale-free features. Here we study the scaling properties of the recently introduced scale-free model, that can account for the observed power-law distribution of the connectivities. We develop a mean-field method to predict the growth dynamics of the individual vertices, and use this to calculate analytically the connectivity distribution and the scaling exponents. The mean-field method can be used to address the properties of two variants of the scale-free model, that do not display power-law scaling.}
